FIX LEARNING LEVEL NAVIGATION AND CASE COMPARISON

**WHAT'S CURRENTLY WORKING (don't change these):**
- Sequence comparison works via individual dropdowns (MRI/SWI for Primary, MRI/FLAIR for Comparison Sequence)  
- Technical/Clinical/Anatomical tabs work perfectly
- Image display and educational content loading works
- Overall interface and styling is excellent

**ISSUE 1 - ADD LEARNING LEVEL PEEK HOVER PANEL (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**

Current Problem: All educational content shows in one long block (Discovery Insight + Focused Learning + Clinical Application + Comprehensive Analysis all visible at once).

What to Add:
- Create ONE peek hover panel on the LEFT side of the entire screen (not just the educational panel)
- Panel should "peek" out ~20-25px from the left edge with hint text like "Learning Levels"
- On hover: panel expands to show four level selection options: [Discovery] [Focused] [Clinical] [Comprehensive]  
- On click on any level: show only that level's content in the main educational panel
- Default to "Discovery" level when switching between Technical/Clinical/Anatomical

Implementation Details:
- Position panel at left edge of screen (independent of educational panel)
- Use same orange accent styling as other UI elements
- Panel contains all four learning level buttons when expanded
- Show only selected level content in main educational area, hide other levels
- Smooth transitions between levels and for panel expand/collapse

Example Content Separation (use existing text exactly):
- Discovery: "SWI makes gas bubbles 'bloom' larger than they really are"
- Focused: The "WHY does SWI show gas best?" paragraph  
- Clinical: The "WHY blooming matters clinically" paragraph
- Comprehensive: The "WHY susceptibility physics work" paragraph

**ISSUE 2 - FIX CASE COMPARISON FUNCTIONALITY:**

Current Problem: "Compare Cases" button doesn't work - shows "No image available" when trying to load trauma case.

What to Fix:
- Make Compare Cases button functional so users can compare Gas Bubbles case vs Trauma case side-by-side
- Ensure trauma case images load properly (trauma_ct_axial files)
- When trauma case selected, show trauma case educational content
- Verify image paths and case data mapping for trauma case

**ISSUE 3 - OPTIONAL FIX FOR "SWI vs T2" DROPDOWN:**
(Lower priority - the individual sequence selectors work fine, but this dropdown is non-functional)

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
- Focus on Issue 1 first (learning levels) as it's most important for usability
- Then attempt Issue 2 (case comparison) 
- Skip Issue 3 unless the first two are quick to implement

**PRESERVE EVERYTHING WORKING:**
- Keep existing sequence comparison via individual dropdowns
- Keep Technical/Clinical/Anatomical tab functionality  
- Keep all styling, colors, and professional appearance
- Keep all educational content text exactly as written
- Don't change overall layout or working features

TESTING:
- Learning levels: Click between Discovery/Focused/Clinical/Comprehensive and verify only selected content shows
- Case comparison: Switch between Gas Bubbles and Trauma cases and verify both images and educational content load properly
