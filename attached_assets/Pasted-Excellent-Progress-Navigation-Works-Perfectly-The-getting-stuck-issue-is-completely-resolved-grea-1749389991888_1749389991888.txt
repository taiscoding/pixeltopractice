Excellent Progress! Navigation Works Perfectly
The getting-stuck issue is completely resolved - great work! The immersive experience feels smooth and the hover-revealed UI is working as intended. Just need some polish refinements:
UI Positioning & Centering 🎯
Current Issue: Hover elements are offset instead of centered

Top hover: "Exit Immersive Mode" appears off-center to the right
Left hover: Knowledge depth slider appears offset toward bottom instead of centered vertically
Bottom hover: Exploration progress appears offset right

Fix Needed: Center all hover-revealed elements:

Top hover → Center the "Exit Immersive Mode" tooltip
Left hover → Center the knowledge depth slider vertically on the left side
Bottom hover → Center the exploration progress bar
Also, top hover should ONLY show "Exit Immersive Mode" (remove the X button - we don't need two ways to exit)

Knowledge Depth Simplification 📊
Current: 5 levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
Needed: 3 levels only:

Focused Learning (0%)
Clinical Application (50%)
Comprehensive Analysis (100%)

Better Layout Organization 🔄
Perfect suggestion! Let's reorganize the hover areas more logically:
New Layout:

Top hover → "Exit Immersive Mode" + Exploration Progress Bar (session info together)
Left hover → Knowledge depth slider + Learning mode controls (learning settings together)
Bottom hover → Case selection (Gas Bubbles | Compare Cases | Trauma Gas)
Right side → Detail modals when nodes are clicked (already working well)

This creates better logical grouping and uses screen space more efficiently!
Functional Fixes ⚙️
Zoom Controls: The +/- and fullscreen buttons should work:

+/- → Zoom the constellation in/out
Fullscreen → Use browser's actual fullscreen API

Missing Feature: Dark mode toggle (add this when convenient)
Apple-Like Polish ✨
Can you enhance the visual refinement throughout:

Smoother gradients and shadows
More elegant typography
Subtle animations and micro-interactions
Consistent design language across homepage and constellation

Testing Request 🧪
The core experience is working beautifully! Can you implement these positioning and functionality fixes? The foundation is solid - just need this polish for the professional demo quality.
