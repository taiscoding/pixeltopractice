OBJECTIVE: Create a full-screen medical image viewer component that opens when the central constellation node is clicked. Use the exact Radiopaedia-style interface with case-specific modality switching.
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Image Data Structure:

javascriptconst imageData = {
  gasbubbles: {
    modalities: {
      "MRI": {
        "FLAIR": "attached_assets/medical_images/gasbubbles_case/gasbubbles_mri_flair.jpg",
        "T2": "attached_assets/medical_images/gasbubbles_case/gasbubbles_mri_t2.jpg", 
        "SWI": "attached_assets/medical_images/gasbubbles_case/gasbubbles_mri_swi.jpg"
      }
    },
    defaultModality: "MRI",
    defaultView: "SWI"
  },
  trauma: {
    modalities: {
      "CT Head": {
        "Axial non-contrast": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ct_axial_noncontrast.jpg",
        "Sagittal non-contrast": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ct_sagittal_noncontrast.jpg",
        "Coronal non-contrast": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ct_coronal_noncontrast.jpg",
        "Axial bone window": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ct_axial_bone.jpg"
      },
      "CT Venogram": {
        "Axial venogram": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ctv_axial.jpg",
        "Coronal venogram": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ctv_coronal.jpg", 
        "Sagittal venogram": "attached_assets/medical_images/trauma_case/trauma_ctv_sagittal.jpg"
      }
    },
    defaultModality: "CT Head",
    defaultView: "Axial non-contrast"
  }
}

Component Structure:


Full-screen modal overlay (z-index high, dark background)
Top bar: Case title, modality label (top-right), close button
Tab bar: Sequence/view switching with orange highlight for active tab
Main image area: Large medical image display with professional styling
Right panel: Patient context + educational content from existing data structure


Styling Requirements:


Dark medical theme: Match Radiopaedia's black/dark gray color scheme
Professional typography: Clean, medical-grade fonts
Orange accent color: For active tabs and highlights (#ff6b35 or similar)
Smooth transitions: Fade between images, hover effects on tabs
Responsive design: Works on different screen sizes


Functionality:


Case-specific modalities: Only show modalities available for selected case
Dynamic tab generation: Generate tabs based on current case's available views
Image preloading: Load images smoothly without flickering
Keyboard navigation: ESC to close, arrow keys to navigate (optional)
Integration: Trigger from existing central node click handler


Integration Points:


Maintain existing constellation functionality: Don't break case switching or educational content
Use existing patient context data: Pull from current case data structure
Cohesive design: Match existing constellation color scheme and aesthetics
State management: Use React useState for current modality, view, and visibility

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

Create new ImageViewer.jsx component
Import and integrate into main constellation component
Add state management for image viewer visibility and current selections
Ensure smooth transitions and professional medical appearance
Test with all 10 medical images to verify correct loading

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

Full-screen professional medical image viewer opens on central node click
Case-specific modality switching works correctly (MRI for gas bubbles, CT variants for trauma)
Default images load correctly (SWI for gas bubbles, Axial non-contrast for trauma)
Professional Radiopaedia-style dark interface with orange highlights
Smooth transitions between images and seamless integration with existing functionality
