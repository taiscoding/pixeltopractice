# Radiology Education Platform - Image-Centric Learning

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT TRANSFORMATION
Transform the medical image viewer into the primary interface with integrated learning modes. Medical images remain the main focus, with educational content adapting based on viewing mode.

## ðŸ¤– REPLIT AGENT PROMPT

TRANSFORM MEDICAL IMAGE VIEWER INTO INTEGRATED LEARNING PLATFORM

**CRITICAL: PRESERVE ALL EXISTING EDUCATIONAL CONTENT EXACTLY AS WRITTEN**
- Do not modify any existing educational text content
- Reuse all "Discovery Insight", "Focused Learning", "Clinical Application" text verbatim  
- Only create new interface to display existing content

PHASE 1 - CORE TRANSFORMATION:

1. REMOVE CONSTELLATION LANDING PAGE:
- Make medical image viewer the primary/default interface
- Remove constellation navigation as separate page
- Keep constellation data structure for educational content

2. ADD LEARNING MODE TABS:
- Add tab navigation in medical image viewer toolbar: [Technical] [Clinical] [Anatomical]
- Active tab highlighted with orange accent
- Panel title updates: "Technical Analysis" | "Clinical Significance" | "Anatomical Context"
- Learning panel content changes based on active tab

3. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT SYSTEM:
**REUSE EXISTING CONTENT - NO CHANGES TO TEXT**

For Technical Mode - display existing Technical node content:
- Gas Bubbles: "SWI makes gas bubbles 'bloom' larger than they really are" + all existing technical explanations
- Trauma: "CT shows intrasinus gas = Traumatic vacuum phenomenon" + all existing technical explanations

For Clinical Mode - display existing Clinical node content:
- Gas Bubbles: "65M immediately post-posterior fossa surgery = Expected gas pattern" + all existing clinical explanations  
- Trauma: "20M trauma + skull fracture crossing suture = Emergency thrombosis risk" + all existing clinical explanations

For Anatomical Mode - display existing Anatomical node content:
- Gas Bubbles: "Subarachnoid space + lateral ventricles = Expected post-op distribution" + all existing anatomical explanations
- Trauma: "Lambdoid suture fracture â†’ Transverse sinus gas â†’ Sigmoid sinus thrombosis" + all existing anatomical explanations

PHASE 2 - COMPARISON FEATURES:

4. COMPARE SEQUENCES (2-image side-by-side):
- Add "Compare Sequences" button in toolbar
- Dropdown selector: [SWI vs T2] [SWI vs FLAIR] [T2 vs FLAIR] [Single View]
- **Suggest starting with SWI vs T2 as it shows the most dramatic difference for gas bubbles**
- Split image viewer into 2 panes when comparison active
- Each pane shows existing educational content for that sequence (unchanged)
- Educational value comes from seeing factual descriptions side-by-side

5. COMPARE CASES (2-case side-by-side):
- Add "Compare Cases" button in toolbar  
- Side-by-side: [Gas Bubbles Case] | [Trauma Case]
- Each pane shows existing educational content for that case (unchanged)
- Helps understand same finding in different clinical contexts

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES:
1. Learning mode tabs (highest priority)
2. Content system using existing educational text
3. Compare sequences feature
4. Compare cases feature

STYLING REQUIREMENTS:
- **PRESERVE existing dark theme and Radiopaedia-style medical interface**
- **MAINTAIN existing orange accent colors throughout**
- Clean medical education appearance
- Orange highlights for active modes and buttons
- Professional radiology interface (keep current dark styling)
- Maintain existing bullet points with medical icons
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Mobile-responsive design
- **DO NOT change existing color scheme, backgrounds, or medical styling**

USER EXPERIENCE:
- User opens case â†’ sees medical images immediately with learning mode tabs
- Clicks tabs to change educational perspective (Technical/Clinical/Anatomical)
- Can activate comparison mode to see sequences or cases side-by-side
- All educational content shows existing text - never modified based on comparisons

PATIENT CONTEXT (preserve exactly):
- Gas Bubbles: "Patient: 65-year-old male | Presentation: Immediately post-posterior fossa surgery"
- Trauma Gas: "Patient: 20-year-old male | Presentation: Fall from bike"

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Medical images are primary interface focus
- Learning modes work smoothly with existing educational content
- Comparison features show 2 images side-by-side effectively
- All existing educational text preserved exactly as written
- Professional radiology workflow feel maintained
```

## ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLIFIED GOALS
This creates an image-centric radiology learning platform that:
- Focuses on medical images (like real radiology)
- Provides multiple analytical perspectives using existing content
- Enables practical sequence/case comparisons
- Preserves all your valuable educational work

## ðŸ’° BUDGET IMPACT
- **Estimated cost**: ~$1-2 for this transformation
- **Risk level**: Low - builds on existing foundation
- **Value**: Transforms into professional radiology education tool
