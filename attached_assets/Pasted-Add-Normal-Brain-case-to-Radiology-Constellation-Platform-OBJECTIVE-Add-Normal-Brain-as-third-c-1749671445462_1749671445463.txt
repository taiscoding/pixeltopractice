Add Normal Brain case to Radiology Constellation Platform:

OBJECTIVE: Add "Normal Brain" as third case option (alongside Gas Bubbles, Trauma)

CASE DETAILS:
- Case Name: "Normal Brain"
- Patient: 20-year-old male
- Presentation: First episode of psychosis  
- Key Finding: Normal brain anatomy, no abnormalities
- Sequences: SWI (adding T1, FLAIR later)

FILE STRUCTURE:
1. Create folder: public/medical_images/normal_brain_case/
2. Image path: /medical_images/normal_brain_case/normal_brain_swi.jpg

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS:

1. UPDATE CASE SELECTION:
   - Add "Normal Brain" to dropdown (alongside "Gas Bubbles on SWI", "Trauma Gas")
   - Update case switching functionality in IntegratedImageViewer.tsx

2. UPDATE imageData.ts:
   - Add normalBrain case object following exact structure as gasBubbles/traumaGas
   - Include SWI sequence in sequences object: 
     sequences: { "MRI SWI": { path: "/medical_images/normal_brain_case/normal_brain_swi.jpg" } }
   - Include patient info, presentation details

3. EDUCATIONAL CONTENT (4 Learning Levels):

DISCOVERY: "Normal brain MRI shows clear anatomy with no pathological changes"

FOCUSED: "SWI sequence demonstrates normal brain with no susceptibility artifacts. Clear gray-white matter differentiation, normal ventricular size, no blood products or calcifications."

CLINICAL: "Normal baseline for comparison learning. Key features: homogeneous signal intensity, preserved anatomical boundaries, no restricted diffusion, normal vascular structures. Essential reference for identifying pathology."

COMPREHENSIVE: "Normal brain SWI serves as educational baseline. Demonstrates: intact blood-brain barrier, normal iron deposition patterns, preserved white matter integrity, normal deep gray structures. Critical comparison reference for identifying microhemorrhages, calcifications, or vascular malformations in pathological cases."

4. SEQUENCE COMPARISON FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Enable Normal Brain SWI vs Gas Bubbles SWI comparison
   - Enable Normal Brain vs Trauma case comparison
   - Maintain existing sequence selection interface

5. EDUCATIONAL TABS:
   - Technical: Normal SWI appearance, imaging parameters
   - Clinical: Normal variants, comparison baseline importance
   - Anatomical: Normal brain anatomy on SWI

CRITICAL: Follow exact same structure as existing cases in imageData.ts. Ensure smooth case switching and sequence comparison functionality.

Test: case dropdown, sequence selection, comparisons between Normal Brain SWI and Gas Bubbles SWI.
